## Overview
Nowadays, traffic is a major issue for everyone, and it is a source of stress for anyone
who has to deal with it on a daily life. The growth of the population delays traffic and
makes it worse day by day. 

The goal of this project is to build a prediction model using multiple machine learning
techniques and to use a template to document the end-to-end stages. We're trying to
forecast the value of a continuous variable with the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume
dataset, which is a regression issue.

The dataset contains about 48k records and 9 features which after all the implementation of all standard techniques like Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Outlier Treatment, etc was feeded to our Classifier which after training and testing, was deployed in the form of a web application.
## Project Goal
This complete project is made as a part of Data Science Internship at [iNeuron.ai](https://internship.ineuron.ai/).
